Cassava weeding is conducted within 2 weeks after rainfall. This can be done by using mechanical weeder specifically designed for Cassava field usage. It is necessary to detect the ArUco marker to conduct the precise navigation to promote operatingsafety of the Cassava Weeder. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to improve the steering systems of the mechanical weeder in Cassava field. ArUco marker detection system was used for navigating the weeder. The GNSS system was developedusing python programming to obtain the GNSS coordinates value. The experiments were conducted at the T-PIRC (TsukubaPlant Innovation Research Center) to set up the base station and rover of the GNSS system. The preliminary results of navigation performance which were obtained at the local grid and GNSS were observed. The deviation value increased steadily until reached 115 cm from the centerline. Further research is required to check the navigation stability and feedback system to reduce the lateral deviation in straight movement and turning.
